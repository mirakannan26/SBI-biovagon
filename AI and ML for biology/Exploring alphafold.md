# AlphaFold Explorer

**Day 11 Activity — Biovagon Summer Bioinformatics Internship 2026**  
**Term 2, Day 11**

## Objective

DeepMind's AlphaFold cracked a 50-year-old biology puzzle: predicting a protein's 3D shape from its sequence alone. Today, you get to use the same database scientists around the world use every day.

## 1. Protein Selection

The following proteins were provided as options for analysis:

| Protein | Why It's Interesting |
|---|---|
| **EGFR** | Your Term 1 project gene linked to lung cancer |
| **Insulin (INS)** | The hormone that controls your blood sugar right now |
| **Hemoglobin (HBB)** | Carries oxygen in every red blood cell in your body |
| **Collagen (COL1A1)** | Makes up ~30% of all protein in your body (skin, bone) |
| **p53 (TP53)** | Nicknamed "Guardian of the Genome" stops cancer |
| **Spike protein (S)** | The famous SARS-CoV-2 protein from every COVID vaccine |

**My chosen protein:** EGFR receptor (mutations in the gene lead to lung cancer)

## 2. Finding the Protein Structure

1. Go to: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk
2. Search for your protein name (try the human version).
3. Click on the top result to open its structure page.
4. You are now looking at a 3D-predicted protein built entirely by AI, in minutes, not months.

**Screenshot:** Attach a screenshot of your protein's 3D structure page.

## 3. AlphaFold Confidence Scores

Notice the structure is colored; this is not decoration. It's AlphaFold telling you how confident it is about each part of the shape. This confidence score is called pLDDT.

| Color | pLDDT Score | What It Means |
|---|---:|---|
| **Dark Blue** | 90–100 | Very high confidence trust this region completely |
| **Light Blue** | 70–90 | Confident generally reliable |
| **Yellow** | 50–70 | Low confidence take with a grain of salt |
| **Orange** | Below 50 | Very low confidence likely a flexible/disordered region |

### Observations

| Question | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| **What color dominates most of the structure?** | Dark blue |
| **Are there any orange/yellow patches? Where?** | Yes, orange – open coil in the periphery and yellow – short segment within the protein |
| **Overall, would you TRUST this structure? (Y/N)** | Y |

**Screenshot:** Attach a screenshot showing the color-coded confidence view.

## 4. Conventional Protein Structure Determination vs AlphaFold

Before AlphaFold, scientists used X-ray crystallography or Cryo-EM to physically determine a protein's shape a process that could take months or years, and cost thousands of dollars, PER protein.

| Parameter | Old Way (Lab Method) | AlphaFold (AI) |
|---|---|---|
| **Time** | Months to years | Minutes |
| **Cost** | Very expensive | Free, computational |
| **Requires physical protein sample?** | Yes | No sequence only! |

## 5. Scientific Interpretation

### Question

If AlphaFold gave your protein LOW confidence (yellow/orange) in a specific region, should a drug company trust that part of the structure to design a new medicine? Why or why not?

### Answer

No, since it is highly flexible and intrinsically disordered, it means that the specific portion can take any conformation and this can depend on the molecule (like a ligand) that binds to it. Therefore, a company developing a drug for this protein should not trust this portion as there is a possibility of a change in structure when the drug comes to bind to the protein, which could prevent the drug from acting on the protein.

## 6. Comparison with a Second Protein

Search for a SECOND protein from the table above. Compare its overall confidence to your first one. Which protein did AlphaFold predict more confidently, and why do you think that might be? (Hint: think about how well-studied or how "normal-shaped" the protein might be.)

### Comparison Notes

The above protein is Hemoglobin subunit beta in humans and is majorly dark blue compared to the EGFR receptor which proves that this has a much better confidence.

This is due to the reason of it being extensively extensively studied proteins. It is a small, compact, globular protein with a stable, well-defined three-dimensional structure composed mainly of α-helices. Its structure has been experimentally determined many times using X-ray crystallography and other techniques, providing abundant data that supports accurate prediction.
